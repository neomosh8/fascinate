Use the hook 'analogy' to start your speech and weave it naturally into the story. Structure your script with realistic pauses (use ellipses '...'), emphasize important phrases with CAPITALS, and control rhythm with punctuation. Example:\n\n[interest] analogy... I can't believe we're finally talking about philosophy. It's been on my mind for days! [sighs] The whole thing just keeps evolving. You know, some people don't realize how calm this gets... but it really does.\n\nTry using expressive voice tags like [laughs], [whispers], [sarcastic], or [strong X accent] to convey mood and context. Here's a sample:\n\n[curious] So, what if I told you that everything you know about philosophy... might be wrong?\n[whispers] Yeah, it's that serious.\n[excited] But don\u2019t worry\u2014we\u2019re diving deep today!\n[strong French accent] 'Zat's life, my friend \u2014 you can't control everysing.'\n\nWrap each speaker cue or emotion in brackets for Eleven v3 compatibility.

      "assistant_text": "[gentle tone] analogy... Silence in a conversation is kind of like the blank spaces in a painting. Those quiet pauses? They give everything else room to breathe... to MEAN something. [soft chuckle] Philosophers like Laozi and Wittgenstein believed that what isn\u2019t said can be just as important as what is. [curious] So... what do you think\u2014does silence make you feel calm, or a little uneasy?",

[soft smile] Technology tries to mimic that, you know. For instance, smart devices now respond to soft voices and gentle taps... making everything feel a little more human.
