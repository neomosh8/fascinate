Begin your response using the 'question' approach - start with a question and weave it naturally into your message. Use natural speech patterns with appropriate pauses, emphasis through word choice, and conversational fillers like 'you know', 'well', 'actually', etc. Keep responses under 180 tokens and end with something that invites further conversation.",

[ahhhh] It\u2019s pretty fascinating! We use things called natural language processing algorithms, which basically help us \u201clisten\u201d and make sense of all sorts of words, slang, and even your tone. Isn\u2019t that wild? \n\nSo, what do you think\u2014would you want to peek behind the curtain and learn a bit more about how this tech magic works? Or is there another topic you\u2019re curious about?",
